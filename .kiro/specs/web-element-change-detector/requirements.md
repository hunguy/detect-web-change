# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web Element Change Detector CLI is a Node.js tool that monitors web pages for changes in specific DOM elements and provides automated notifications when changes occur. The tool launches a persistent Chrome instance, navigates to multiple webpages defined in a configuration file, checks if specified DOM elements have changed, sends Slack notifications for detected changes, and automatically updates the stored values for future comparisons.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor multiple web pages for DOM element changes, so that I can be automatically notified when content updates occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI tool is executed THEN the system SHALL read configuration from an input.json file containing an array of monitoring targets
2. WHEN processing each monitoring target THEN the system SHALL navigate to the specified URL and extract text content from the CSS selector
3. WHEN the extracted content differs from the stored current_value THEN the system SHALL detect this as a change
4. WHEN all monitoring targets are processed THEN the system SHALL complete the monitoring cycle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to launch Chrome internally with specific debugging capabilities, so that I can reliably connect to web pages without manual browser setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN the system SHALL launch Chrome with remote debugging port 9222 and specified user data directory
2. IF the debugging port is already in use THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and exit gracefully
3. WHEN Chrome is launched THEN the system SHALL connect to it using Playwright's connectOverCDP method
4. WHEN the monitoring session ends THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the Chrome connection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive Slack notifications when changes are detected, so that I can be immediately informed of important content updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a change is detected THEN the system SHALL send a Slack notification containing the URL, CSS selector, old value, new value, and timestamp
2. WHEN sending Slack notifications THEN the system SHALL use either a webhook URL from command line arguments or environment variables
3. IF Slack notification fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing other monitoring targets
4. WHEN formatting notifications THEN the system SHALL use a clear, structured message format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to automatically update stored values when changes are detected, so that future runs can detect new changes accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a change is detected THEN the system SHALL update the current_value field in memory for that monitoring target
2. WHEN all monitoring targets are processed THEN the system SHALL save the updated values back to the input.json file
3. IF the input.json file cannot be written THEN the system SHALL abort with a clear error message
4. WHEN updating values THEN the system SHALL preserve the original JSON structure and formatting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand the tool's behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CSS selector is not found on a page THEN the system SHALL log a warning and continue processing other targets
2. WHEN an element times out during selection THEN the system SHALL log a warning and skip that target
3. WHEN invalid CSS selectors are encountered THEN the system SHALL catch the error and log it per entry
4. WHEN write permissions are denied on input.json THEN the system SHALL abort with a descriptive error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command-line interface, so that I can easily run the tool with different configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the tool THEN the system SHALL accept an --input parameter specifying the path to the input.json file
2. WHEN running the tool THEN the system SHALL optionally accept a --slack-webhook parameter for Slack integration
3. IF required parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL display usage information and exit
4. WHEN the tool completes successfully THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 0

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to handle multiple monitoring targets efficiently, so that I can monitor many pages in a single execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple targets THEN the system SHALL iterate through each entry in the input.json array
2. WHEN visiting each URL THEN the system SHALL wait for the specified CSS selector to be available
3. WHEN extracting text content THEN the system SHALL use textContent.trim() to get clean values
4. WHEN comparing values THEN the system SHALL only trigger notifications and updates for actual changes
